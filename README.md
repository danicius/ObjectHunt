#This is Vision Video Roulette,

An app developed for the new Apple Vision Pro. 
The development of this app was inspired by the lack of the typical YouTube app on the Apple Vision Pro. 
We wanted users to have a similar viewing experience as the YouTube app, whether they were seeking entertainment, education, or inspiration. 
This is when we came up with the idea of Vision Video Roulette. Our project was built using the Swift UI’s web kit and we used Xcode to develop our app for the Apple platform. 
This project was a perfect opportunity for us to dive into Swift UI and utilize Apple’s framework for building user interfaces that works for the vision pro. We also learned how to integrate the YouTube video playback by embedding web content directly into our app using the web kit. 
The app’s design keeps simplicity in mind, which allows the user to navigate new videos through a click of a button. We created an array of YouTube video IDs that served as our data model and implemented logic to randomly load videos from that data model. 
In addition, one of the main limitations of this project was the lack of information on the Apple Vision Pro, given its recent release. We had to rely on Apple’s documentations to handle the interactions between Swift UI and YouTube video player.
The biggest challenge was our inability to test our project considering the difficulties in connecting the vision pro to our functioning code and having our app physically appear on the vision pro’s environment. 
Overall, this project was the perfect avenue for us to employ our creativity and explore a domain that is unfamiliar to all of us.
